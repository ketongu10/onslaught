After death, the boss (or its friends) declares war on the player. The progress of the war is displayed in the gui at the top of the screen. When the time comes, groups of foes appear near the player's house. It can be small groups of mobs, or it can be whole armies. And then siege starts! Enemies will break down your buildings, devour your crops, exterminate your pastures and of course slay all the defenders! The war ends when the player kills all the mobs or after time has passed. 



There are four types of wars: 

Patrol - for weak bosses or mobs. In one minecraft day your housing is visited by 5 mobs - allies of the slayed mob
Siege - when you capture an enemy fortress and kill its lord, the allies of the fallen soldiers advance troops towards your home. The journey usually takes 3 days. And then the assault begins. The level of training of the enemy can be different - someone uses catapults, balistas, tnt, someone relies only on numerical superiority. You need to be an extremely powerful warrior or have your own army to survive any of these fights!
Ambush - some enemies prefer not to act openly. Be careful leaving your home - there may be detractors hiding in dark forests and caves, waiting for their victim.
Apocalypse - you won't survive this night!
